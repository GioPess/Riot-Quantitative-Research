## \# **Income Inequality and an Innovative Approach to Its Measures** {#-income-inequality-and-an-innovative-approach-to-its-measures}

## **Overview**

This repository contains research on income inequality and the
introduction of a novel measure, the **MMG ratio** (Mean-Median-GDP
ratio). The study explores the relationship between traditional
inequality measures, such as the Gini coefficient, and the newly
proposed MMG ratio. The research applies statistical analysis and data
visualization techniques to investigate income disparity across various
countries.
