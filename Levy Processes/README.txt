#  Applications of Levy Processes in Finance: Asset Price Simulation, Risk Management, and Option Pricing with Jump Diffusion and Variance Gamma Models

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive exploration of the applications of Levy processes in finance. Levy processes are stochastic processes with stationary independent increments, making them a powerful tool for modeling financial markets. This notebook delves into asset price simulation, risk management, and option pricing using two popular models: the Merton Jump Diffusion model and the Variance Gamma model. The notebook covers simulation techniques, risk management strategies, option pricing applications and data visualization.
